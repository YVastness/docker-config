Furious at the gods' judgement, and unable to kill Antiope on the spot (lest the curse would fulfill itself immediately), Megalomania Cadmos renounces the gods and proclaims himself one. To this end, he and Ermione undergo a treatment with mystical vapors which render their bodies invulnerable (save for Achilles' heel on Ermione's chest incautiously left covered).","language":"eng","IsPrimary":true}]},"contentRatings":[{"id":548,"name":"NR","country":"usa","description":"Not Rated","contentType":"movie","order":0,"fullname":"NR"}],"companies":{"studio":[{"id":49305,"name":"United Artists Pictures"}],"network":[],"production":[],"distributor":[],"special_effects":[]},"production_countries":[{"id":78546,"country":"ita","name":"Italy"}],"inspirations":[],"spoken_languages":"[fra,ita]","first_release":{"country":"global","date":"1962-05-04"}}
