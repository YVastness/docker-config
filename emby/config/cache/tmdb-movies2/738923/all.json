The lyrics are by DuBose Heyward and although not thought to be directly involved, Ira Gershwin gets an official credit.

It has been recorded and performed in many different languages around the world and remains one of the most famous and best loved songs ever written. This documentary looks at its history, how it came to be created, and its subsequent history as it traveled through time and around the world. \"Summertime\" is the most covered song on the planet. At least 25,000 versions of it exist.","popularity":0.3219,"poster_path":"/sRWF2piffFBcGucJzrCmi1BeqFS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gershwin's Summertime: The Song That Conquered the World","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"casts":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1342414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Black","original_name":"Pauline Black","popularity":0.1546,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f4f8f635c071b00311952c6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Maycock","original_name":"James Maycock","popularity":0.0527,"credit_id":"5f4f8f48e8131d003750928b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"GB","primary":false,"release_date":"2011-11-23T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"file_path":"/sRWF2piffFBcGucJzrCmi1BeqFS.jpg","height":750,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}],"backdrops":[],"logos":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236508,"name":"summertime"},{"id":248301,"name":"song"}]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
